# NUBM08 and NUBM44 barrel

This barrel is designed to tightly fit around the NUBM44 and NUBM08
diodes (with thermal grease) and retain the diode with an M12 retaining
ring from the top. In contrast to many commercial packages this should
provide enough heatsinking capabilities to not kill diodes pretty fast ...

* Bottom side should include an M9x0.5 threading for common off the shelf optics
* Drilled ID is 7mm
* Seat for laser diode is 2mm high, 9.1mm in diameter (should be 9mm but since
  some of the common off the shelf diodes are extracted from modules allowing
  half a milimeter per side debris; fill with thermal grease)
* On the top an M12 threading is cut
* The diode is held in place by a retaining ring with M12 outside threading
  and 7mm ID for cables passing through (should use some more common M12 thread
  like M12x1.0)
